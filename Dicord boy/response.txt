You're getting the "cannot call on null instance" error, which is a very common issue in Godot (and programming in general). This error means you're trying to do something with a variable that doesn't currently hold a valid reference to an object â€“ it's essentially empty.

**Here's a breakdown of the error and how to troubleshoot it:**

1. **Understanding the Error:** Godot uses the concept of "null" to represent the absence of a value.  When you try to call a method (like `.instantiate()`) or access a property of a variable that's null, you get this error. 

2. **Common Causes:**

    * **Typographical Errors:** Double-check that you've spelled the variable name correctly everywhere.
    * **Scope Issues:**  Make sure the variable is accessible in the part of the code where you're using it. If it's defined in a different function or script, you might need to pass it as an argument.
    * **Loading Problems:** Verify that you're loading the scene or resource correctly using `load()`. If the file path is incorrect or the file is missing, the `load()` function will return null. 
    * **Node Order/`@onready`:**  If you're trying to access a node from another node in your scene, ensure the node you're trying to use is loaded and available. Using `@onready var my_node = $Path/To/Node` is a good practice for this.
    * **Conditional Statements:** Check if you have any `if` statements or conditions that might be preventing a variable from getting assigned a value before you try to use it.

3. **Debugging Steps:**

    * **Print Statements:** Add `print(your_variable)` before the line of code causing the error to see if it's printing `null`.
    * **Debugger:** Godot's debugger is your friend! You can use it to pause the game's execution, step through your code line by line, and inspect variable values to see what's going wrong. 

**To help me give you more specific guidance, please share the following:**

* **The relevant code snippet:** The part of your code where the error occurs, including the line that throws the error. 
* **What you're trying to do:** Explain what you want to achieve with that code.
* **Any error messages:** The complete error message from Godot's console.
